I am entrepreneur, Data Scientist. I know Machine Learning, Python, SQL, BigData Technologies, NLP, Version Control, ETL, API Integration and STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. I strive to bring innovation, empathy and collaboration.

I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Applied Physics with a specialization in Optics, as well as a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics. I am a Data Scientist and an entrepreneur with experience in calculating photovoltaic systems, configuring sales machines, leading sales teams, experience in the pharmaceutical industry and development new projects.

I am a curious and entrepreneurial individual, passionate about working towards a healthier and more sustainable future. I am interested in joining businesses and job opportunities that align with these values, leveraging my expertise in Data Science. I know about machine learning, Python and statistical analysis.

Throughout various projects, I have demonstrated resilience, negotiation skills, collaboration, teamwork, and the ability to train other team members. While I have often achieved my goals, I understand that not every attempt is successful. I am now eager to offer my skills to a health-related startup and continue learning new things.
